# dot-tasks agent snippet

Use the local `dot-tasks` skill at `skills/dot-tasks/SKILL.md`.

If requested work is multi-file or likely to take more than 30 minutes, ask whether to create a `dot-tasks` task before implementation.

During work:

- Use `dot-tasks create` and `dot-tasks start` to enter tracked execution.
- Keep `plan.md` updated with implementation steps after planning.
- Record meaningful progress using `dot-tasks update --note`.
- Prefer `dot-tasks` commands over direct edits to task state files.

After implementation and verification, ask whether to mark the task complete with `dot-tasks complete`.
